This will give an error since the function isn't generic as it appear to be. With methods and attributes, we can define instructions specific for an object with attributes that are suitabble for the function. Like we can have a method chop, that exists for all vegetable. The specific kinds of vegetable classes can be inherent from Vegetable class. It just makes more sense"
